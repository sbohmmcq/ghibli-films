            <h2 class="tagline">If you want a fantasy with a strong environmental message…</h2>
            <section>Then Princess Mononoke is for you. Released in 1997, it was Ghibli’s most successful movie until Spirited Away. It is set in a fanatical feudal Japan where a young prince is caught up in a conflict between the ecologically-rapacious denizens of an industrial town intent on clearing a huge forest to mine for iron, and the diverse spirits who live in the threatened woods. It’s almost a companion piece to My Neighbour Totoro, with more battles and demons and rather unpleasant people.</section>

            <h1 class="name">Spirited Away</h1>
            <h2 class="tagline">If you want an Oscar winner…</h2>
            <section>Begin with Spirited Away (2001), which won the best animated feature trophy at the 2003 Academy Awards, and pretty much encapsulates the whole Ghibli ethos. Thanks to its high profile, this is often the movie that has introduced people to Ghibli. It’s a stunningly-realised tale of a 10-year-old girl, Chihiro, who is travelling with her parents to her new home. When her father takes a shortcut, Chihiro ends up lost and alone in the spirit world, and has to navigate a dreamlike landscape, populated by increasingly grotesque characters, in order to save her parents.</section>

            <h1 class="name">Howl's Moving Castle</h1>
            <h2 class="tagline">If you want a fairytale fantasy…</h2>
            <section>That description doesn’t really even touch the sides of Howl’s Moving Castle (2004). Loosely based on the 1986 Diana Wynne Jones novel, it features a strong anti-war message (apparently fuelled by Miyazaki’s opposition to the 2003 US invasion of Iraq) as two feuding kingdoms in a European-flavoured fantasy world go head-to-head, with the maverick magician Howl caught in the middle as his precarious castle on legs criss-crosses the war-torn territories. Young milliner Sophie is cursed by the Witch of the Waste and transformed into an old woman who gets caught up in Howl’s fight to not be drafted into the devastating war. Utterly captivating and memorable.</section>
